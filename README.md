# Hey there! I'm **Jack**.

I am a student at the University of Waterloo studying software engineering who is interested in data science, distributed algorithms, and concurrent computing.

I have worked as an SWE at BlackBerry, as a machine learning software developer at Geminare, and as software developer in the FUS Lab at Sunnybrook Hospital.

I am the VP of Education for the Waterloo Data Science Club. I have designed and presented workshops on neural networks, computer vision, and clustering. 

**I am looking for September - December 2021 internship opportunities. If my skillset interests you, please reach out to me!**
